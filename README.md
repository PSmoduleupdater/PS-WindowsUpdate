# PS-WindowsUpdate
Module to handle Windows Updates

Classic Windows Update Module for powershell.

You can download this folder in the Windows Powershell one, then import it with Import-Module, simple as that.

Also, when importing could show some error since the name of these function are not Ps-like, but it works perfectly.
